GUI - or Graphical user interface is more user-friendly and
is a cleaner cut than the CLI - command line. Command line can be
less forgiving and difficult to remember all the commands to find
a certain item or do a certain thing. Whereas GUI is up-front about
where things go and how to do a certain thing with the search bar.
